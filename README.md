# Containers & workflows lesson hackaton
This is a draft repository for organizing and collecting materials for the containers &amp; workflows course. 

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 in order to identify potential gaps in training across ELIXIR with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the identified gaps. The aim of the hackaton is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of **Docker and Singularity containers** and **Nextflow** pipelines, these are the selected technologies. 

The aim of the hackaton consists of two parts:
- Rough scaffold of the material, including learning outcomes, learning objectives and learners' profiles
- Creating the materials, identifying potential exercises and producing a first draft of the content

## Find materials that already exist
Make a separate folder/markdown file/... with a link to all relevant course materials that already exist.

## Learning outcomes
Define learning outcomes

## Learning objectives

Containers:
- Learn the concept of and the difference between Docker & Singularity containers 
- Write a Docker recipe, build and run a Docker image and containers
- Pull and push Docker container to / from Docker hub
- Docker files and layers; Docker cashing
- Working with volumes
- Pull Docker containers as a Singularity image

Pipelines:
- Understand Nextflow's basic concepts: processes, channels, ...
- Write and run a Nextflow pipeline (using a Singularity containers)

## Learner profiles
- Familiar with bioinformatics on the command-line.
