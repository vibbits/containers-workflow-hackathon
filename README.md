# Containers & workflows lesson hackaton
This is a draft repository for organizing and collecting materials for the containers &amp; workflows course. 

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 to identify potential gaps in training courses and materials with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the major identified gaps. The aim of the hackaton is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines, these are being put forward as technologies. 

## Overview hackaton program: 
Hackaton on two different days:
will be focused on drafting a framework for practical training materials, including defining training goals, expected outcomes, and participants’ profile
- First day: drafting a framework for practical training materials, defining learning objectives, collect existing materials, define participants' profile, etc. 
- Second day: purpose of finalizing the materials and designing exercises for hands-on training

Materials authored during the hackathon will be publicly available through GitHub, under a CC-BY license, to be reused both within and outside ELIXIR.
