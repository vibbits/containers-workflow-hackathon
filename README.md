# Containers & workflows lesson hackathon
This repository contains all practical information regarding the containers &amp; workflow pipelines training materials hackathon.

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 to identify potential gaps in training courses and materials with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the major identified gaps. The aim of the hackathon is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines, these are being put forward as technologies. 

## Overview hackathon program & documents: 
Hackathon on two different days:
will be focused on drafting a framework for practical training materials, including defining training goals, expected outcomes, and participants’ profile
- First day: drafting a framework for practical training materials, defining learning objectives, collect existing materials, define participants' profile, etc. 
    - Date: 10 February 2021
    - [Contribution document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRVBccvT_HTrBn-YOcH7JolTN72rtWV-/edit#)
- Second day: purpose of finalizing the materials and designing exercises for hands-on training. 
    - Date: 6 April 2021  
    - Contribution documents are online available at hackmd.io and can updates are automatically pushed to the markdown documents in the [materials](./materials/) directory. 
         - containers training materials on [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/krqYgepjTN-f0F_9hptJNA)

Materials authored during the hackathon will be publicly available through GitHub, under a CC-BY license, to be reused both within and outside ELIXIR.
