# Containers & workflows lesson hackaton
This is a draft repository for organizing and collecting materials for the containers &amp; workflows course. 

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 in order to identify potential gaps in training across ELIXIR with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the identified gaps. The aim of the hackaton is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of **Docker and Singularity containers** and **Nextflow** pipelines, these are the selected technologies. 

## Overview to-do: 
First: identified core group (experts motivated in the topic) they led the activity during the hackaton (max 10)
- Training platform, pre-identify and put it on mail to training-coordinators. 
- Doodle for meeting time and discuss and find a date for first day. 

Hackaton on two days:
- first day: prepare learning objectives, collect existing materials, what expertise is available or experts are available. 
- Second day: prepare in a way the curriculum for the course. 
 if we would be ambitious we would create the full content. 

## Find materials that already exist
Make a separate folder/markdown file/... with a link to all relevant course materials that already exist.

## Hackaton outcomes
To be confirmed with the Core Identity Group. The aim of the hackaton consists of two parts:
- Rough scaffold of the material, including learning outcomes, learning objectives and learners' profiles
- Creating the materials, identifying potential exercises and producing a first draft of the content
In principal, a collection of existing materials and overviewable structurization, outline & eventually working on content of course. 

## Hackaton objectives

Containers:
- Learn the concept of and the difference between Docker & Singularity containers 
- Write a Docker recipe, build and run a Docker image and containers
- Pull and push Docker container to / from Docker hub
- Docker files and layers; Docker cashing
- Working with volumes
- Pull Docker containers as a Singularity image

Pipelines (Nextflow/Snakemake):
- Focus on Nextflow DSL2
- Understand Nextflow's basic concepts: processes, channels, ...
- Write and run a Nextflow pipeline (using a Singularity containers)

## Learner profiles
- Familiar with bioinformatics on the command-line. 


## Other ideas:
- How to access the HPC
