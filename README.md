# Containers & workflows lesson hackathon
This repository contains all practical information regarding the containers &amp; workflow pipelines training materials hackathon. A website was generated containing the created materials in an overviewable way and is available [here](LINK).

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 to identify potential gaps in training courses and materials with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the major identified gaps. The aim of the hackathon is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines, these are being put forward as technologies. 

## Overview hackathon program & documents: 
Hackathon found place on two different day, the master repository is available at [this link](https://github.com/vibbits/containers-workflow-hackathon/): 
- First day: focused on drafting a framework for practical training materials, including defining learner's profiles, learning objectives and outcomes. 
    - Date: 10 February 2021
    - [Contribution document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bRVBccvT_HTrBn-YOcH7JolTN72rtWV-/edit#)
- Second day: purpose of finalizing the materials and designing exercises for hands-on training. 
    - Date: 6 April 2021  
    - [Draft program](https://github.com/vibbits/containers-workflow-hackathon/blob/master/hackathon-materials/planning-day2.md)
    - Contribution documents were online edited at hackmd.io, the final documents were pushed as Markdown files into the GitHub repository.
