## Previously on: C&W training materials hackathon

| Time | Scope |
|------|-------|
|  Day #1 of Hackathon  | - Collected existing materials & set the scope <br/> - Defined learnersâ€™ profiles (i.e. target audience) <br/> - Specified Learning objectives and, <br/> - Specified Learning outcomes  |
| Before day #2 of Hackaton | - Reformat / Restructure all notes <br/> - Create a skeleton structure of the material (pending approval) |



## Structure for each training materials

Two persona's: user vs developer. For each persona: 
- Learner's profiles:
    - Who are they?
    - What challenges are they facing? 
    - How will the lesson/workshop help them?
- Learner's objectives
    - Prerequisites for the course/tutorial
    - Define exercises with learning outcomes (measurable)*

- Training materials: outline of exercises


## Idea

Focus on developing modular training materials exercises which together make up for a nice story:
- Exercise
    - Answering to LO # 
    - Before exercise have done:
    - Define task
    - Write solution

## Goal for today

- Confirm structure and flow of the content
- Confirm learning outcomes per group 
- Prepare the first set of hands-on exercises that target specific learning outcomes (one or more)
- Glue the exercises together
- Identify potential timeline for final release
