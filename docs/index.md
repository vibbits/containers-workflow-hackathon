# Containers & Workflow pipelines Training Materials

This website contains the training materials created by a joint effort of the below listed contributors during the ELIXIR Training Materials hackathon on the topic of Containers & Workflow pipelines. The repository containing the original documents and collaborative notes are available [here](https://github.com/vibbits/containers-workflow-hackathon). 

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 to identify potential gaps in training courses and materials with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the major identified gaps. The aim of the hackathon is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines, these were chosen as technologies. 

```{warning}
This set of tutorials and exercises does not aim to give you a thorough understanding in Docker and Nextflow, however focus on delivering extra exercises usable during other running courses or for further practice.
