# Containers & Workflow pipelines Training Materials

This website contains the joint efforts for the ELIXIR Training Materials hackathon on the topic of Containers & Workflow pipelines. We thank our [contributors](#Contributors)

## Background information
The ELIXIR Training Platform ran a survey in 2019 to identify potential gaps in training courses and materials with containers and workflow pipelines considered to be one of the major identified gaps. The aim of the hackathon is to develop training materials and relevant use-cases, freely available and useful for 1) organizing courses on the topic and 2) self-learning. A plethora of choices exist as to which technologies that can be used regarding containers and workflow pipelines, however with recent increase in the popularity of Docker and Singularity containers and Nextflow pipelines, these are being put forward as technologies. 

## Courses:
